# imdb-friends-link
A Chrome extension for imdb.com that simply adds a easy to find anchor/link to the friends page

## Problem
IMDB doesn't have a quick anchor/link to the friends page, so this extension adds one to the main menu.

## Chromestore
This extension is available in Google Chromestore: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imdb-friends-link/ihnbokeofndighklfankoldjdldpffhl?hl=en

## Disclaimer
The code relies 100% on the UI of IMDB, so if IMDB decides to change their UI, the code may stop working. (And that's why the code is in GitHub, for you to fix it!)
